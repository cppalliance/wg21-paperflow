"""Table selection: one reading per region, trusted only when another kind of evidence agrees.

Independent readers propose tables (``TableCandidate``): the text-position
detector (``table.detect_tables``, source "tomd"), the PDF's accessibility
tags (``tagged.py``), and the readers ported after them. ``select_tables``
groups the proposals by position, picks one reading per region, and sets its
confidence from agreement between readers plus rule checks:

  - another reader agrees cell for cell (or the text reading is a correct
    subset of a ruled table)                     -> HIGH
  - only one reader found the table              -> UNCERTAIN
  - readers found it but disagree                -> UNCERTAIN, every version kept
  - the cells lose or repeat the text of the
    table's area (``conservation_error``), cell text read out of order,
    a damaged text layer, an open extent          -> UNCERTAIN

A reading that fails the rule checks (``table_flags``) and has no better
version is dropped, so its text stays in the document as prose; the evidence
record keeps it. A selected reading of paperflow's own detector keeps that
section's table kind and rendering strategy.
