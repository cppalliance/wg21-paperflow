"""Stacked entries are one row each (table convention, "Rows: one row per entry").

Several entries stacked in one drawn band, on baselines shared across columns
("Linux / QNX / NetBSD" beside three function names), are one row each; a cell
whose text wraps is still one row (a wrap breaks at a space, so a line of one
token followed by another line is a new entry). Learned from the vision readers (Table
Transformer, Docling): a line is its own row unless something shows it wraps.

A row is split between two baselines when the lower baseline holds lines in
two or more columns, one of them the row's first column (where an entry's key
sits), and, in every column with a line on both baselines, the
upper line did not run to the column's edge (the next line's first word would
have fitted after it) and the lower line is not a word joined to the upper
one. Rows of C++ statements (a line ending in ; { or }, a preprocessor line, a
comment) are code blocks and are
never split, nor are rows holding a listing (monospace lines with words on them,
such as assembly); the header row and all-bold rows are left as they are.
