"""Full-width rows in drawn tables: titles and spanning rows read as spans.

A boxed table often has rows that run across every column: a title over the
table ("[comma.value-category]", set right-aligned), a link or an
explanation under the code. The page shows it directly: the internal vertical
rules that separate the columns elsewhere do not cross that row. A reader
that follows the structure tree or the cell grid puts the row's text in
whichever column it happens to start in; under the span convention a cell
spanning several columns holds its text in the first column, with empty
cells after it.

So: in a table with internal vertical rules, a row that none of them
crosses and that has exactly one non-empty cell is a full-width row; its
text moves to the first column and the row is recorded in the metadata
(full_width_rows: title for the first row, data otherwise). Tables without
internal rules are left alone - no rule is not evidence of a span.
