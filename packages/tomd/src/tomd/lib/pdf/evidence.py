"""The evidence record: what every table reader saw, nominated and rejected, and why.

A reader that looks at an area and decides "not a table" records the area, the
rule that decided, and the kind of information the rule used. Later steps (the
region scan, the prompts, the paper summary) read the record instead of each
reader's private verdict, so nothing is dropped without a trace.

One record per conversion, held by the run's context (``runctx.RunContext``).

Information types: "words" (text positions), "paths" (drawn lines, boxes,
shading), "tree" (tagged structure), "meaning" (content kinds, poll
vocabulary, code similarity), "document" (captions, counts, generator).
