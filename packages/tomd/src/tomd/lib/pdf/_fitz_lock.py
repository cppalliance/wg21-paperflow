# PyMuPDF (fitz) is not thread-safe. MuPDF's C-level global state (font store,
# glyph caches, warning buffer fitz.JM_mupdf_warnings_store) is shared across
# all fitz.Document objects in a process, and fitz releases the GIL for C-level
# calls so threads genuinely run MuPDF code in parallel. All code that opens or
# drives a fitz.Document must acquire this lock for the full duration of the
# open/close session.
# Current fitz sites: pipeline.py (run_pipeline), docling_backend.py (_extract_docling_tables).
# Update this list when adding a new fitz caller.
