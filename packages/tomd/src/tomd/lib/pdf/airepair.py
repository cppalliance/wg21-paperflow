"""The AI step's pure pieces: what to ask about a flagged table, and how an answer is used.

tomd never calls a model. The agent that asks (open question 7: in paperflow's
pipeline framework, `pipeline.run_agent` with RepairAnswer as its output type,
retries and usage limits) lives outside run_pipeline; the step is off unless
that caller runs it. tomd gives the agent:

  repair_request(sec, words)  the instructions and the table area's words, by
                              index; None when the table is not asked about
  apply_repair(sec, answer, words)
                              the answer's arrangement checked and, when it holds,
                              put in place of the table's cells

An answer can only arrange the given words (indices): it cannot add, change or
drop text. It is rejected when an index is unknown or used twice, a word is left
out, the rows are ragged, the layout check against the page fails, or it adds a
column of bare line numbers to code. A repaired table stays flagged (L4); the
first reading is kept in the metadata and the evidence record.
