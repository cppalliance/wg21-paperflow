"""Graded table levels (L0-L5) and cell markers, from the table's own evidence.

HIGH / UNCERTAIN says only whether to trust a table; a reader of the output
(an agent evaluating the paper) also needs to know how a flagged table may be
wrong, so it can tell a nearly-right reading from a misattributed one:

  L0 trusted               HIGH: independent sources agree
  L1 likely                flagged, but the words fit the drawn cells evenly
  L2 minor                 flagged on one source only; every check on content passed
  L3 structure uncertain   readers disagree, the fit or layout check failed, relational
                           violations, the extent is open (a table may continue)
  L4 content at risk       text duplicated or misattributed (conservation surplus),
                           damaged text, cells read out of order, a reader error, repaired
     L4 incomplete         text of the area missing from the cells, nothing duplicated or
                           out of order: content missing, what is there is not contradicted
  L5 mark only             a possible table that was not produced (a mark, not a table)

The most severe level that applies is the table's level. Cell markers list the
cells where the table's alternative readings (same shape) disagree. Levels are
metadata: the table's content is unchanged.
