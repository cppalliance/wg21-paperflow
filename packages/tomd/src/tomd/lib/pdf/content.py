"""One content-first row/column builder for every table class.

The layout class only locates the region; inside it, rows and columns come
from the words themselves, top down:

  lines    words sharing a baseline (vertical overlap) form a visual line
  pieces   words in a line closer than a word gap form a piece (a phrase)
  columns  gutters: x ranges that (almost) no piece crosses, over all lines;
           columns are the spans between gutters that hold pieces. A piece
           crossing a gutter in at most _SPAN_LINES lines is a spanning cell
           (a header over several columns), not evidence against the gutter.
  rows     a line starts a new row when the vertical gap above it is a row
           gap (the region's own natural break between line leading and row
           spacing), or - when gaps do not separate rows (LaTeX booktabs,
           p{} wraps with row spacing equal to leading) - when it has text in
           the key column (the leftmost column filled in most rows) and the
           line above was not a lone wrap of that column. A line that fills
           only some columns, continuing cells from above, joins the row
           above (wrap continuation).
  cells    the pieces of each row and column, joined in reading order.

Every decision is recorded (`trace`) so a specialist's evidence can be
compared against it: drawn rules, box edges and tags confirm or contradict
this grid; they do not build it.
