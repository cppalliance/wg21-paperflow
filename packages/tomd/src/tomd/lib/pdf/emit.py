    The PDF can split a single heading line across several ``Line`` objects
    with wide horizontal gaps (ISO/standardese headings lay out
    "1   Scope   [scope]" as three lines on one baseline). Rendering only the
    first line would emit the bare section number ("## 1"); markdown headings
    are one line, so the lines sharing the heading's baseline are joined.

    Only the heading's own visual row is joined: a section that wrongly
    absorbs a following body line must not pull that prose into the heading,
    and such a line sits on a lower baseline. Identical line texts are also
    collapsed: some PDFs overprint a heading several times at the same
    position to simulate bold, and joining those verbatim would repeat it.

    Bold is suppressed because the ATX prefix already conveys heading weight.
    When line 0 is a bare section number (e.g. "1", "3.2", "I."), subsequent
    lines at the same font size are joined to recover the title text that
    MuPDF split onto a separate line.

    Deliberate trade-off: grouping is purely same-row. A heading whose title
    genuinely *wraps* onto a second baseline has its continuation emitted as a
    body paragraph below the heading, not folded back into the heading line.
    The older line-continuation heuristic (trailing comma/conjunction, etc.)
    was dropped for simplicity; wrapped section titles are rare in the WG21
    corpus and no golden regressed. Body prose that a heading section wrongly
    absorbs sits on a lower baseline too and is handled by the same rule, so
    the simpler grouping serves both. ``test_emit_heading_excludes_lower``
    ``_baseline_body_line`` pins this behaviour.

    Row membership keys on each line's vertical midpoint, not its top edge:
    on a single visual row mixing font sizes (a large section number beside a
    small-caps title) the glyph tops differ even though the baselines align,
    so the midpoint tracks the shared baseline far more robustly. This matches
    the midpoint convention used in ``cleanup.py``.

    If the heading section contains additional body lines (e.g. table cells
    merged into a single section), those are emitted as a paragraph below
    the heading so content is not lost.
