"""Round-trip self-verification of an extracted table against the page.

A table read by only one source has no second opinion. Instead of a second
extractor, put the extracted grid back onto the page and check that it is
consistent with where the words actually are:

  - every word in the table's area falls in exactly one cell's box
    (no cell boxes overlap, no word is outside every cell);
  - each cell's words, read in page order (top to bottom, left to right),
    spell the cell's text;
  - rows are stacked: a row's band does not overlap the next row's band;
  - columns are side by side: column bands keep their order and do not
    overlap, except a cell that is alone in its row (a title bar, a
    spanning header), which may cover several columns.

A table that passes is consistent with the page geometry. Whether that is
enough to trust it alone is measured per class before it is used (see
classify.gate_tables).
