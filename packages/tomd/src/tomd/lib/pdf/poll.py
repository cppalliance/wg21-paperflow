"""WG21 poll result tables.

WG21 papers and minutes record straw polls in a fixed shape: a header line
"SF F N A SA" (Strongly For, For, Neutral, Against, Strongly Against) with
the vote counts in the line below, one count under each header. Authors draw
it in many ways - ruled, unruled, inside a coloured box, tab-aligned - and
the other table sources miss most of them (too few rules, no tags), so this
source looks for the shape itself.

A poll is recognised when a text line consists of exactly the five header
tokens in order. Rows of numbers directly below whose numbers sit under the
header columns are its counts (up to _MAX_ROWS). A suggested poll with no
counts yet is emitted with an empty vote row when one is drawn under the
header, otherwise as a header-only table. A header followed by text on
the same line ("SF F N A SA: 4 5 1 0 0") is inline prose and is left alone.
