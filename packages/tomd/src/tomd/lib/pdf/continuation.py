"""A note on table pieces that may continue the previous page's table (2026-10-24).

When a table piece reaches the bottom of its page's content area and the next page's first table
piece starts at the top of that page's content area, the next piece is noted as possibly
continuing the previous one. The note names the evidence seen: reaches the bottom, starts at the
top, and, when present, the same header row and the first column's numbering continuing.

Since 2026-10-24 the note is written only when the first column's numbering also continues across
the break (US 019 → US 020): with the page-edge signals alone it was right 55 of 150 times on the
tuning sets. It never joins pieces, changes cells or changes
levels, so the note says "may", and the pieces stay separate.

The content area of a page excludes page furniture: lines whose text (digits ignored) repeats
within 3 pt of the same position on an adjacent page.
