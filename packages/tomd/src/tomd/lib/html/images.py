"""HTML side of the embedded-image flow.

Reads the typed ``<pid>.html-images.json`` manifest that the mailing
fetcher wrote alongside the source HTML, applies the same 20-image cap
the PDF path uses (see :mod:`tomd.lib.pdf.images`), and returns a list
of :class:`ExtractedImage` records for sidecar persistence accounting.

Pure module: no network, no disk reads of image bytes. The bytes are
already on disk from mailing time. The convert step no longer rewrites
``<img>`` references - images never reach the markdown (#408) - so this
result only feeds sidecar persistence accounting and the truncation
marker.
